This is an example we are developing using teamsfx. This is way easier to develop since the AAD settings and other stuff is automatically handled for us. 
Install the teamsfx cli using these commands.
npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
teamsfx -h

Then we can just lauch a local debug with this command.
teamsfx preview --local
