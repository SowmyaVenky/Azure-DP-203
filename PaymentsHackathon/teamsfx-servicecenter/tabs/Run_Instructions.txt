This is an example we are developing using teamsfx. This is way easier to develop since the AAD settings and other stuff is automatically handled for us. 
Install the teamsfx cli using these commands.
npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
teamsfx -h

Then we can just lauch a local debug with this command.
teamsfx preview --local

This project contains 2 parts. Server component that is under the api folder. 
We need to start the server from the api directory with npm start.

After this we can use the teamsfx preview --local from the project root folder and it will start up the client side.
