In this experiment we are going to test the performance of 3 databases running as containers and as managed services or virtual machines. Here are the steps we are going to follow.
1. Create a managed instance of postgres single server (2 core, 50 GB storage)
2. Create a managed instance of mysql server (2 core, 50 GB storage)
3. Create a virtual machine with the MSSQL 2019 enterprise loaded. 
4. Load hammerDB on a windows VM, and fire the tests to see the TPS.  


### 
Set the path to allow for loading the postgres dlls.
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\lib;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Router 8.0\lib
cd C:\Venky\DP-203\SowmyaVenkyRepo\HammerDB-4.4
