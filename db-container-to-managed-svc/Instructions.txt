In this experiment we are going to test the performance of 3 databases running as containers and as managed services or virtual machines. Here are the steps we are going to follow.
1. Create a managed instance of postgres single server (2 core, 50 GB storage)
2. Create a managed instance of mysql server (2 core, 50 GB storage)
3. Create a virtual machine with the MSSQL 2019 enterprise loaded. 
4. Load hammerDB on a windows VM, and fire the tests to see the TPS.  


### 
Set the path to allow for loading the postgres dlls.
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\lib;C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Router 8.0\lib
cd C:\Venky\DP-203\SowmyaVenkyRepo\HammerDB-4.4
hammerDBcli
checklibrary

## First point the test runs against docker containers and collect stats.
Images are stored in the directory to show stats. Interesting that postgres performed way better than MSSQL and MYSQL. Same dataset, same load (10 users), and same computer. 

## backups of databases.
pg_dump -U postgres tpcc > tpcc_postgres.sql
